    <h2>James Richards</h2>
    <h2>"Jamie"</h2>
    <p>I grew up around Tampa Florida, I am 37, am married, and a huge gamer.  I am currently playing Starfield, and when I'm done grinding out this week's course work, I am looking forward to playing some more!</p>
    
    <p>I was born Pentecostal and grew up that way until I was 23, at which point I started looking to see what I believe.  When I was talking to a friend on Xbox Live, playing Griffball in Halo 3, I joked that his missionary friends never called me back.  I had talked to some Elders on the phone, not realizing they are at the MTC and basically about to head out.  So he offered me lunch as he actually lived near where I worked.  We had Thai, went to the nearby church building, and with a few bumps and one false baptism date later, I was baptized.  While I have been on again off again in the years since, I always feel that it is the biggest part of my life.</p>
